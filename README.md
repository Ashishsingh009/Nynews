# Project Title

Ny News

## Getting Started

*MVVM Architecture: In MVVM, ViewModel exposes streams of events to which the Views can bind to. Like this, the ViewModel does not need to hold a reference to the View anymore, like the Presenter is. This also means that all the interfaces that the MVP pattern requires, are now dropped.
*Android Databinding: Part of Android Jetpack, is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
*Dependancy Injection(Daggar2):- Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version created by Square and now maintained by Google. 
*Android JUNIT4: Build local unit Test cases.
*Retrofit- For n/w calling using okhttp client.
